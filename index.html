        <p><strong>A new report shows</strong></p> 
      <font size="5">
       <main>In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic
decline.
 <p>        
That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit
organization that closely monitors penguins and other <font color="red"> Antarctic seabirds</font>, in
collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in
New York.<p>
Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660
sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health
of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and
gentoo. Like endangered <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-plan-on-threatened-polar-bears-lacks-teeth-critics-say/">polar bears</a>, penguins have come to represent
vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/climate-change/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">climate change</a>.<p>
The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by
a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years.
There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to
changing circumstances.<p>
